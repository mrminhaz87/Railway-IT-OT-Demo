This platform will simulate the operations of multiple trains on various tracks, each equipped with distinct sensor-signal controls. Additionally, it will emulate a normal corporate network with various user activities to simulate the Information Technology (IT) environment. The program will offer several different modules to simulate Level 0 (Physical Process Field I/O device) to Level 5 (Internet DMZ Zone) of an IT-OT environment, as illustrated below:

### Detailed Sub-System Design

The detail introduction of each component is shown below: 

#### 1. 2D Railway[Metro] System Real-world Emulator

Our objective is to develop a Railway system emulator that accurately simulates real-world scenarios, including trains navigating tracks, responding to signal systems, docking at stations, and being controlled by train drivers. The system encompasses four tracks, ten trains, a track junction signal control system, a station control system, and a train driver controller. Additionally, the emulator facilitates connectivity to three sets of PLC modules through a dedicated PLC interface. This comprehensive design aims to provide a realistic and dynamic railway simulation environment. 2D Railway[Metro] System real-world emulator UI:

- Visualizing the current state of connected PLCs, including holding register states, coil states, and digital I/O states.
- Providing a visual representation of the state of tracks, including sensor and signal states, along with an overview of the sensor-signal auto-controlling process.
- Displaying the state of tracks and train-station sensors and signals, along with insights into the auto-controlling processes.
- Implementing an overload control mechanism for sensor and signal states, accessible with appropriate administrative engineer debug permissions.
