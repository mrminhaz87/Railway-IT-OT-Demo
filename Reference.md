# Technique Reference Manual

The project "Railway IT/OT System Cyber Security Test Platform" aims to simplify and simulate key features of real-world railway control chains. This document provides an overview of the technique references utilized in designing the OT environment for our railway system, encompassing track cross sensor-signal PLC control, station sensor-signal PLC control, railway track PLC and RTU control, as well as train PLC and RTU control.

The design of the railway OT network is inspired by a model railway system emulation project detailed at https://www.nepaview.com/model-train-plc-project.html. For the real world railway system using the similar design logic, our project follows the Mitsubishi electric's railway infrastructure solution for the London underground.

#### Real-World Railway System Reference

The real-world application of PLC and RTU systems for monitoring and controlling railway infrastructure is exemplified by the Mitsubishi's railway infrastructure solution for the London Underground. We refer to the public document "RAIL infrastructure solution for rai industry processes" 's managing rail industry processes section, signaling section and asset monitoring section.
